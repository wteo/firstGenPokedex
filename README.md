# First Generation Pokedex

Pokemon is a popular videogame series featuring fantastical elemental monsters called Pokemon (short for "Pocket Monsters") that a player can catch and train to fight other players. I came across the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI</a>, an API that contains data for each Pokemon, including its height, weight, types and battle stats. The Pokemon franchise remained a popular franchise amongst millenials and the younger generation. Hence, I thought it'll be a fun project to create an unofficial Pokedex (short for "Pokemon Index") listing all the original 151 Pokemon that a user could use to learn more about their favourite monsters.

I built the first version of the <a href="https://github.com/wteo/firstGenPokedexOld">Pokedex</a> in February 2022 out of vanilla JavaScript whilst learning the Fetch method.


After learning 

With React and Redux, I revised this old Pokedex project (https://github.com/wteo/firstGenPokedexOld) and made it a much more interative and completed app.
