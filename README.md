# First Generation Pokedex

<h2>About</h2>

Pokemon is a popular videogame series featuring fantastical monsters with elemental powers called Pokemon (short for "Pocket Monsters") that a player can catch and train to fight other players. I came across the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/" target="_blank">PokeAPI</a>, an API that contains data for each Pokemon, including its height, weight, types and battle stats. The Pokemon franchise remained a popular franchise amongst millenials and the younger generation. Hence, I thought it'll be a fun project to create an unofficial Pokedex (short for "Pokemon Index") listing all the original 151 Pokemon that a user could use to learn more about their favourite monsters.

<h2>Version History</h2>

<h4>Version 1.0</h4>

I built the first version of the <a href="https://wteo.github.io/firstGenPokedexV1/" target="_blank">Pokedex</a> in February 2022 out of vanilla JavaScript.

The first Pokedex left a lot to be desired. It only has a simple box design featuring the image sprite of a Pokemon and its basic details and it only acts as a list with no search feature or interactivity. In spite of this, it was sufficient at that point in time for me whilst learning and understand the Fetch method.

<h4>Version 2.0</h4>

After I started learning React and felt comfortable enough with the UI Library, I decided to create a more complete and interactive version of the <a href="https://github.com/wteo/firstGenPokedexV2" target="_blank">Pokedex</a> with the use of states, hooks and Redux. Unlike the initial version, this version has the basic features that allow users to:
* Search for Pokemon by type or species;
* View basic data of each Pokemon, including the Pokemon sprite image, species name, type(s), height and weight; and
* Navigate through pages of Pokemon search results.

<h4>End Words</h4>

I have no intention to commercialize this project. This is a simply a fun app I built in the hopes that it'll also give some entertainment value to users who have nostalgic feel for this franchise. As an added bonus, the project has helped me to familiarize the more advanced concepts of React and Redux.
