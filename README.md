# First Generation Pokedex

<h2>About</h2>

Pokemon is a popular videogame series featuring fantastical elemental monsters called Pokemon (short for "Pocket Monsters") that a player can catch and train to fight other players. I came across the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI</a>, an API that contains data for each Pokemon, including its height, weight, types and battle stats. The Pokemon franchise remained a popular franchise amongst millenials and the younger generation. Hence, I thought it'll be a fun project to create an unofficial Pokedex (short for "Pokemon Index") listing all the original 151 Pokemon that a user could use to learn more about their favourite monsters.

I built the first version of the <a href="https://github.com/wteo/firstGenPokedexOld">Pokedex</a> in February 2022 out of vanilla JavaScript.

The first Pokedex left a lot to be desired. It only has a simple box design featuring the image sprite of a Pokemon and its basic details and it only acts as a list with no search feature or interactivity. In spite of this, it was sufficient at that point in time for me whilst learning and understand the Fetch method.

After I started learning React and felt comfortable enough with the UI Library, I decided to create a more complete and interactive version of the Pokedex. And this is the <a href="https://master--benevolent-chebakia-d0ea73.netlify.app/">result</a>.

After learning 

With React and Redux, I revised this old Pokedex project (https://github.com/wteo/firstGenPokedexOld) and made it a much more interative and completed app.
